##Overview of approach

The AWS DevOps Monitoring Dashboard solution is a reference implementation that automatically deploys a set of AWS WAF (web application firewall) rules that filter common web-based attacks. Users can select from preconfigured protective features that define the rules included in an AWS WAF web access control list (web ACL). Once deployed, AWS WAF protects your Amazon CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers by inspecting web requests.

You can use AWS WAF to create custom, application-specific rules that block attack patterns to ensure application availability, secure resources, and prevent excessive resource consumption.

This solution can be easily installed in your AWS accounts via launching the provided AWS CloudFormation template.

AWS WAF Security Automations architecture

AWS Managed Rules (A): This set of AWS managed core rules provides protection against exploitation of a wide range of common application vulnerabilities or other unwanted traffic.

Manual IP lists (B and C): This component creates two specific AWS WAF rules that allow you to manually insert IP addresses that you want to block or allow. You can also configure IP retention and remove expired IP addresses from these IP lists.

SQL Injection (D) and XSS (E): The solution configures two native AWS WAF rules that are designed to protect against common SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) patterns in the URI, query string, or body of a request.

HTTP flood (F): This component helps protect against attacks that consist of a large number of requests from a particular IP address, such as a web-layer DDoS attacks or a brute-force login attempt. This feature supports thresholds of less than 100 requests within a 5 minute period.

Scanners and Probes (G): This component parses application access logs searching for suspicious behavior, such as an abnormal amount of errors generated by an origin. It then blocks those suspicious source IP addresses for a customer-defined period of time.

IP Reputation Lists (H): This component is the IP Lists Parser AWS Lambda function which checks third-party IP reputation lists hourly for new ranges to block.

Bad Bots (I): This component automatically sets up a honeypot, which is a security mechanism intended to lure and deflect an attempted attack.
